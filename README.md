## File description


1. Monodominance_TOY_MODEL.nlogo
	this is an edited version of Martinn's old netlogo model.
	I included disturbance and some sliders to play around.

2. mono993.nlogo

	This is the netlogo model provided by JÃ¼rgens Hiwi, Lukas.
	It is basically the model from Martin but with a global seed dispersal
	kernel for the non-monodominant species.
